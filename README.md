# DTMF Signal Processing and Time-Frequency Analysis in MATLAB

## üìö Overview

This project, developed as part of the **Digital Signal Processing Basics (ECE 451s)** course at Ain Shams University, explores **Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF)** signal generation and decoding using **MATLAB**. It also covers **time-frequency analysis** through spectrograms using both rectangular and Blackman windows, highlighting trade-offs between time and frequency resolution.

## üéØ Objectives

- Understand and generate DTMF signals.
- Perform time-frequency analysis using spectrograms.
- Explore frequency resolution vs. time resolution trade-offs.
- Decode noisy DTMF sequences using the **Goertzel algorithm**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- `sym2TT(S)`: Generate DTMF tones for a given symbol.
- Sequence generator with guard intervals based on a phone number.
- Additive white Gaussian noise simulation.
- Save noisy signal as `.wav` audio file.
- Plot time-domain and frequency-domain representations.
- Generate spectrograms with multiple window sizes.
- Evaluate effects of different window types (rectangular vs. Blackman).
- Decode DTMF tones using the Goertzel algorithm.

## üß™ Technologies

- MATLAB
- DSP concepts: DFT, FFT, spectrograms, windowing
- MATLAB built-ins: `fft`, `audiowrite`, `imagesc`, `goertzel`, etc.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `.m` files in MATLAB.
3. Run the script `main.m` (or your primary driver file).
4. Ensure the required audio and signal processing toolboxes are installed.
5. Inspect generated waveforms, spectrograms, and decoded outputs.
